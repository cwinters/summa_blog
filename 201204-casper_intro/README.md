# README: 2012-April Introduction to CasperJS

You should be able to open the web page `web/sample_form.html` and see
what's going on -- fill out the form, click on elements, etc. 

To run CasperJS against it you'll need to put the `web` directory
in the control of a web server somewhere. Once that's done and
you've got Casper installed, you should be able to do:

    $ casper test/one.js
    
to execute that script.
