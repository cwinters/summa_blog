# README: 2012-April JavaScript Scoping Gotcha

This was [published in the Summa blog][1] on May 22.

All the JavaScript examples are in one file: `scoping.js`. If you
have Java installed you can execute them with Rhino, referenced
by the `js` file here. Just do:

    $ ./js scoping.js

Or if you're on a Win32 machine you should be able to rename `js`
to `js.bat` and achieve the same result.
