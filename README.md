# README: summa_blog

Code and other docs backing my Summa blog entries. The text for
the articles is in markdown, but it's not guaranteed to match
one-to-one with the text published
[on the Summa blog](http://summa-tech.com/blog). There are always
a few little things that get modified but aren't roundtripped
back to the source.

Also, I tend to date the directories based on when I start an
article. So it may vary (wildly!) from the actual publication
date.
